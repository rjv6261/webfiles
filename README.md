# webfiles
A place where I host files. Dont run these on your local machine if they are memory affecting, 

YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE SCRIPT IN THE WIKI! (HERE - https://github.com/rjv6261/webfiles/wiki)

Here you will find a hopefully, ever-growing list of all the files that I write to do certain things and the versions and software they affect. Each, may also have a little read me about it. 

EDIT : I decided that I am just going to put any and all files here that I have used in my pentest. All of them have been changed by me but not all are owned by me and I am not claiming to own all of them. This is publicly accessible for free.
